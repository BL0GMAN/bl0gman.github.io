Lovers of the occult and esoteric - rejoice!


**Biblioteca Philosophica Hermetica**, also known as [The Ritman Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_Philosophica_Hermetica), is a private Dutch library which brings together manuscripts and printed work in the field of Hermeticism and is located in the center of Amsterdam. 

The library holds more than **23,000** volumes on **hermetica, Rosicrucianism, alchemy, mysticism, gnosis, esotericism and comparative religion**, and has great scientific and artistic value. Among the treasures of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica are the *Corpus Hermeticum* published in 1471 (pictured above), the first illustrated edition of Dante's *La Divina Commedia* from 1481, and Cicero's *De Officiis* printed in 1465.

It is one of favourite places of **Dan Brown**, author of *The Da Vinci Code*, and he got a lof if inspiration for his books there. He decided to donate **â‚¬300,000** to the library a couple of years ago to **digitize** it's rare pre-1900 books on **alchemy, astrology, magic, and theosophy**.
