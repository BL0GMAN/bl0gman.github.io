Bertrand Rusell

*“War doesn’t determine who’s right, only who’s left.”*

P.S.: "War doesn’t determine who’s right, only who’s left” is a popular anti-war slogan, cited in print from at least 1932-1933. The saying is often credited to philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), but there is no documented evidence that he ever said it.
