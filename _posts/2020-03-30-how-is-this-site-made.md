After considerable time, thinking about how to build my blog, trying different things and platforms, I decided to build my site with **Jekyll** and host it on **Github**. 

Why? **Because it's super easy and, most imporantly, free!**

Jekyll is nice if you want to build and test your site locally then upload to Github's servers and you have free hosting! Of course you need to have a personal domain as well and these usually cost some money. But you can get very cheap hosting for sites that end with domains such as *.xyz, .space, .today,...* and many others.

This approach requires very basic understanding of coding and git. you can learn it very easily as you have **a lot of tutorials and documentation** online.

No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install-just your content. **Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS** go in. **Static sites come out ready for deployment**. Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.

Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.

Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free.

## Theme

The theme I've chosen is called [Mundana](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mundana). Clicking the link will lead you to the download and [here](https://bootstrapstarter.com/bootstrap-templates/mundana-theme-jekyll/) are the instructions on how to install and use. For hosting on Github you also need a Github account as well.
