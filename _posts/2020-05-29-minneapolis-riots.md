In Minneapolis, US things are heating up. Literally. In the last hours infuriated people started rioting.

What started out as a peaceful protest has turned into full on confrontations with local authority. Police station has been set on fire and invaded. The angry mob forced the police officers out of their station. Other buildings and businesses have been demolished since and several gun shots were fired.

It all happened because an unarmed black man named George Floyd died in police custody. Angry protesters demand justice and say they will not stop rioting until the police officers that were involved are arrested. 

Law authorities say they have to investigate further before making judgements. Although the video evidence is present where unnecessary violence was used by the police officer...

Protests are now spreading to other cities in the US as well. Even the president Trump tweeted about sending National Guard if things get out of hand.

Let's hope justice will be served as soon as possible. Enough of repression!
