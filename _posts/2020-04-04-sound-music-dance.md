When I was younger I had a reoccurring dream of endlessly falling off a cliff and hearing the voice of what I then thought was God. As I was always drawn to investigate the nature of reality through my studies and different techniques I started to realize how precious our experiences are. At the end of our journey on this world that is all that counts.

According to Hinduism sound is the first force that came into existence and is still present throughout the Universe. That sound is the primordial 'Om/Aum/‡•ê'. When this realization struck me I started to work with sound and the dreams I had as a child came rushing in my memory after two decades of oblivion.

My path began in the subgenre of electronic music called psychedelic trance. It was my first real dance experience where for the first time I felt like my physical, spiritual and mental parts were connected as one - sort of an active meditation. In this state I found unity of being, mindful awareness of my own senses, thoughts and emotions.

Sound is healing. Every sound or a combination of them produces their own unique vibrational patterns - the field of research exploring this is called 'cymatics'. And since we are made mostly of water our own molecules vibrate when sound is introduced. When this sound becomes music, especially dance music, we start to feel the resonance of every particle of our bodies and in turn start to move - or better yet - dance.

When I play music for the audiences I try to create a sacred space through the medium of sound. My experiences playing at various types of international events and experimenting with different soundstyles gave me a special perspective and a unique technique on how to achieve this. 

Through the use of modern technologies combined with ancient knowledge the sound becomes our playground in which we allow ourselves to bridge the gap between body/mind/soul and achieve the state of active meditation through ecstatic dance experiences like our shamanic ancestors did.
