Ever since I was a child I enjoyed reading books. My innate thirst for knowledge has lead me on a path full of surprises.

I like to call myself a "knowledge junkie". 

Why use the term "junkie"? Well, you know, it is sort of a lifestyle, constant struggle with an object of temptation, in my case knowledge, and using it sometimes just to procastrinate; without purpose.

So it seems.

Eventhough I found myself absorbed by the infinite wisdom of books and, later in life, all the data that the Internet could provide me I always found myself in situations where all the things I've read were extremely useful for me and my life in that particular case.

You know, sometimes I had a feeling that what I was doing, reading all those books and surfing Wikipedia or the World Wide Web, was a complete waste of time and that my addiction to knowledge and data was merely a way to get away from real life, like a junkie trying to escape by getting high...

But somewhere inside of me a voice was always there telling me to trust the process of Life and gain as much knowledge as I can so I can utilize it in the present moment and in the future when I get enough wisdom with experience. This voice is still here.

## Outlook

I have benefited a lot and changed my lifestyle so I can learn as much as possible, devouring and hoarding knowledge in all forms that humanity can produce. I believe in us as a species and I know we can manage to build a future we all deserve. Frankly the outlook is not so colourful in these days but we have the tools now to create what we desire with respect to our planet and most importantly to ourselves.

### Thoth/Hermes

I would not consider myself religious but I like to explore topics related with different religions, their history and impact on our culture. I am mostly interested in the symbolic interpretations of various ideas that live in the noosphere of our Mother.

That is why at the right side of the picture in this article you can see **[`Thoth`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus)** (slovensko *Tahuti*), Egyptian god of **wisdom, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art, judgement and the dead**. 

He is equated with [**Hermes Trismegistus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus), author of [The Emerald Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet), the founder of Hermeticisim and one of the fathers of Alchemy, beginner of Tarot. His Greek association is Hermes.

The ceremony depicted in the picture is called "**Weighing of the Heart**", you can find out more about it [here](http://www.egyptian-scarabs.co.uk/weighing_of_the_heart.htm).

Thanks for reading,
till next time!
