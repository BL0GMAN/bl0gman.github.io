We all have a lot of files that are extremely important for our lives. 

Keeping those files **safe and always at hand** is a problem that arises fairly quickly if you find yourself in need of those files. Be it music, documents, movies, certificates - you name it - these pieces of data represent our digital twins, our life's information.

*And you wouldn't want just anyone accessing your sensitive information would you?*

Having **hard drives** is very nice and useful but it's difficult to access them from different devices, especially if you don't have the disks near you.

So the most popular alternative for data storage is **cloud storage**, online. 

The provider of choice for the vast majority of people is **Dropbox**.

But most of those people don't know that Dropbox has had numerous problems with data security breaches. Just take a look at [this](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dropbox-data-breach-68-million-user-account-details-leaked) example where they lost **68 million user accounts**! 

For some of us this is completely absurd. Those who value their data and privacy should not put their own files in the hands of a company whose technology is easily hacked and abused.

That is why I use [MEGA](https://mega.nz/aff=-1YdjzoEbGw) cloud storage.

**MEGA.co.nz** is a service for storing your files online - **encrypted**. Which basically means that event he company itself has no access to your data and does not know what you are storing online. And no hacker can than access those files as well.

And that's not all folks! MEGA provides **50GB of free** storage! So I suggest you [make an account](https://mega.nz/pro/aff=-1YdjzoEbGw) today and try it out for yourself :)

Having your files encrypted means that you need a **good password** which you **MUSTN'T** forget! If you forget it, you lose access to your account and your files. And because encryption is used the download/upload is slightly slower.

For those of you that just want to send files securely, you can do so with [Fairdrop](https://fairdrop.xyz/). For stability and larger file you can also use [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/).

Thanks for reading,
till next time!
