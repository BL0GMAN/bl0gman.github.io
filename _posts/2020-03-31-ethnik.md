Besides my interest in knowledge I actually have a small entrepreneurial endeavour in the [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) field. Below you can find the description of what we do.

## Ethnik

**Ethnik** serves as a bridge between the world and the blockchain ecosystem, mostly **Ethereum**. At Ethnik we are connected with the latest developments in the blockchain sphere and follow the trends of current and future exceptional bleeding-edge technologies. We provide guidance to individuals and/or organizations on how to use different decentralized applications and can work together to achieve your goal.

Bitcoin is just entering it's teenage years, Ethereum has flourished magnificently in the last 5 years and other exciting powerful blockchains are being created more and more. The whole area is blooming and constantly changing; that is why being up to date is extremely important.

Creation of **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** systems and the ability to monetise and run infrastructure for supporting these new blockchain networks offer a fresh opportunity for the creators of a decentralised future to truly put their vision to work and help usher the evolution of global information and value transfer while providing benefits for those who help materialise the transition.

With **new business models** created thanks to blockchain technology, it is now possible to advance this trustless, transparent and fair tool to the point of general usage, all while helping those who venture in these realms to earn rewards while doing it.

> Our mission is to educate the general public about the latest developments and help companies set up their blockchain environments to utilise the full potential of the biggest invention since the creation of internet.

We are always available at our e-mail address [info@ethnik.life](mailto:info@ethnik.life).

Our website at [https://ethnik.life/](https://ethnik.life/) is currently only available in Slovenian language but we will soon update it with English content as well.
