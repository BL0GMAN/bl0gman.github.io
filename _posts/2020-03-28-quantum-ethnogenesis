Many of us strive today for good causes. The world is in desperate need of help. Some of us in the Western world are privileged regarding the satisfaction of our basic needs — we have water, food and shelter provided for us — while the rest of the world struggles to fulfill their basic needs or achieve their dream goals — life of the Elite. Of course our world is not black and white but let us assume some of us have a better “starting point”. But what does that mean?

The times are rough; on one side we fight for our own freedom through liberation by meaningful contribution to society and on the other side we tackle problems which are, in essence, totally artificial — product of modern times, and as such, disconnected from our true nature. So we sometimes believe.

When we do finally manage to breakthrough and create something truly valuable we are confronted with the facts that what we are doing is just perpetuating the machine of capitalism which brought us first in this place of eternal self-fullfiling doubt.

And before we know it we are teaching our children the doctrines which we, when we were teenage anticomformists, rebelled from.

“Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster… for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.” — Nietzsche.

All of this leads to a certain **duality**. Two extremes of the perception of ourselves. We are finally doing something worthy and we are being paid for it and, on the other hand, we are nothing more than puppets to the workings of the endless beast. How do we position ourselves?

Man has always struggled with opposing forces; our particular situation is not new. However, we are in a unique position in time and space as a species, that is obvious. The multitude of stimuli and data we process everyday is ever increasing and people who haven’t been touched by the swift flow of a global information transfer will soon feel the strong winds of change.

If words and symbols represent our knowledge then we are truly experiencing a rearrangement of our world(s). Layers upon layers of interdependent meanings and interpretations, sometimes of the same thing. Our own definition of reality is slowly but firmly changing.

**Enters the new Eon; the Quantum Era — a world of infinite possibilities.**

Our civilisation did a great many things to elevate and lighten the human experience on Earth. But what has that lead us to? Blinded governments perpetuating wars and creating artificial crises? Enormous gap between the ultra rich and the mega poor? An ocean of (mental) diseases? Global web of knowledge (the internet), controlled by a handful of companies? Is this what we fought for? Is this what are ancestors gave their life for?

> It is our responsibility to create a better world for our children and pass them the Flame in all it’s glory and might. I question myself if we are consciously fullfiling this mission.

Let us not deviate from the topic in question. Quantum Era. It sure sounds nice, but hey — what does it mean!? In this glorious world we have co-created some of us question the nature of reality through scientific experiments. Rigorous examination, able to be repeated by anyone with the right tools and motivation, is our ultimate source of indisputable knowledge.

Science creates the world, henceforth, science is our construct to view the world. As such, it is comparable to religion; some experiments confirm what is real and what is not — there are certain dogmas which become hard coded fact in a specific period of history (until proven wrong in the future). **Truth fluctuates and is ever changing.**

What do all these open possibilities and unanswered questions mean? How can we benefit by questioning? I believe there is an answer.

Physics is everywhere. Whether you love it or hate it, you are under it’s influence; you can not deny gravity. And the physics of our times is getting more and more connected to the quantum realm, the realm of weird interactions and new, emergent properties. We are beginning to get a glimpse into the world of quantum behaviour, energy and particles which were only conceivable in the mind — and can now be measured.

The duality of light; behaving like matter and behaving like a wave — whatever she feels like. Or better put, whatever we perceive of her. Observing seems to be essential. Therefore, **we — the observers — are (co)creating reality**.

When explaining quantum computers the media likes to sum it up with an explanation such as: “Quantum computers are able to perform operations not just with a 0 or 1 but 0 and 1, 0 and/or 1 or both or anything in between (sometimes at the same time)”. This is called [Quantum Superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition):

> “…any two (or more) [quantum] states can be added together (“superposed”) and the result will be another valid [quantum] state…” — Wikipedia

Yes, easy to comprehend right? Left is Right, Right is Left and when we combine them we get… I don’t know, Forward? Well, it’s easier to imagine then try to actually realise it on real-life examples. This is because our whole life we were taught that all things are one or the other. There was no middle road or other possibility of existence — things are either good or bad, working or broken, real or unreal, normal or not normal, black or white etc.

This leads me to the next question:

> How can we strive to achieve quantum computing through quantum processes if we, as a collective, can not understand that some things are something, nothing, everything or anything in between — sometimes at the same time?

We can try but until humanity as a whole doesn’t start to realise this “quantum superposition” we will not transcend our physical boundaries. Classical physics will be our ruler. Until we internalise the fact of **multiple realities intertwining** or, if you would, multiple views of reality and learn to accept them and live with them, even if they oppose our own views, we will not be able to achieve quantum supremacy over our mundane world.

Of course achieving quantum supremacy is not necessary at all — we can continue to live our lives as they are.

**But will we succeed in acknowledging, comprehending and accepting an external “quantum reality” when it comes clashing with our own and puts another totally justifiable vision of the same situation in direct opposition with ours?**

This is a question of great importance.

As much as some individuals try to present these opposing views, they are always confronted with people that most of the time criticise such a stance point. If you accept both sides then sooner or later the representatives of one of the two side will start to look badly upon you. “Why are you representing both sides when only our side is true?” And when you try to strengthen your standpoint you usually end up with a fight or an argument where the two sides (even if they are in you) start to battle each other — something we call “[group polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization)” in psychology. Each side starts to defend their beliefs more and more firmly and that can easily escalate to different types of aggression.

There are various methods of tackling this. Because there are more solutions than there are problems. Which is totally fine — you have to remember this! Come to the realisation that multiple opposing views of the same thing can exist and that there are ways for **peaceful coexistence** of entities bearing such views.

*There is no need for battle, no need for war.*

**Our mission, as a collective, is to find all the new properties “Quantum Superposition” can unlock and help them come into reality by co-creating them without personal attachments to any particular side, without judgment. We can shape and give advice but we must not judge.**

**Before any quantum computers will emerge we must build a Quantum Civilization where we can thrive in respectful support and love towards each other without boundaries of time and space — devoted to true knowledge and inspiration that infinite co-creation can offer.**
