Well what do you know?

A little virus comes and we are closed in our own homes. 

The times are telling us to focus on ourselves, **look inward** and start to collaborate, internally, between all parts of our own psyche. 

So different things can come to fruition in these periods of change and we can *come out together healthy*, in **mind, body & spirit**.

#### Diary of a Blogman

So out of *spare time, the creative urge caused by the rapid global change and the desire to liberate ideas* I decided to share with the outer world my research process of Life itself. 

There is a lot of material that I read/see/do/hear/make daily and it would be a shame I would not share it. But most importantly this will be my **diary, a memoir** of all the random, weird things I encounter.

You will find writings on topics such as nature, science, technology, blockchain, art, spirituality, esotericism, psychedelics, famous quotes, my own views on wordly happenings, commentaries of various sorts and a lot of random, interesting stuff.

> I hope when reading this blog you will learn something useful for yourself on your journey through this world and perhaps find it enjoyable as well.

Good luck,

Damjan MariÄ‡ / Blogman
