Two of biggest megacorporations have announced a partnership in creating a solution which tracks users through Bluetooth technology.

Original announcement [here](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/).

[Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) is already dictating our lives especially now when we are mostly at home. In these times main communication channels are online and these companies have to power to serve and filter content they (don't) want.

And now governments around the world are starting to tighten their control over the behaviour of their citizens. This announcement proves it and speaks for itself; big tech is helping governments get even more control, surveillance and tracking. Talking about a free world!

It's not surprising Google and Apple announced their partnership only [4 days after the EU called for a single tracking app](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52189551)! My Slovenian readers can also read an article regarding this subject on the [National Radio and Television website](https://www.rtvslo.si/evropska-unija/bruselj-spodbuja-k-uporabi-mobilnih-podatkov-in-podaljsanju-omejitve-vstopa-v-eu/519993).

Another extreme measurement for the global elite to strengthen their influence and control, again diguised as a safety measure against the spreading of The Virus.

Let me know what you think in the comments below. I was also thinking about writing an article how to stay safe and private, which tools to use in an ever increasing survelliance society. Be sure to let me know if that interests you as well.

Stay safe and thanks for reading,
till next time!
